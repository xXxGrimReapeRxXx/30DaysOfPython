Day 4: Python Operators 🌟🎉🚀

Hello, Pythonista! 🎉👨‍💻👩‍💻 Welcome to Day 4 of the 30 days of Python code challenge. Today, we're focusing on Python Operators. So let's get started!
Python Operators 💪

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python has several types of operators:

    Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.

Example:

# Arithmetic operators x = 10 y = 3 print(x + y) print(x - y) print(x * y) print(x / y) print(x % y) print(x ** y) print(x // y)

    Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

Example:

# Comparison operators x = 10 y = 3 print(x == y) print(x != y) print(x > y) print(x < y) print(x >= y) print(x <= y)

    Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

Example:

# Logical operators x = 10 print(x > 5 and x < 15) print(x > 5 or x < 4) print(not(x > 5 and x < 15))

    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Example:

# Assignment operators x = 5 print(x) x += 3 print(x) x -= 3 print(x) x *= 3 print(x) x /= 3 print(x) x %= 3 print(x) x //= 3 print(x) x **= 3 print(x)
Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁

    Assign a number to a variable. Use each arithmetic operator with this variable and a number of your choice, then print the result.

    Assign two different numbers to two different variables. Use each comparison operator with these variables, then print the result.

    Use each logical operator with the comparison of these two variables and print the result.

    Use each assignment operator with one of these variables and print the result.

Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻💻🌟


Day 4 Continued: String Manipulation in Python 🌟🎉🚀

Hello again, Pythonista! 🎉👨‍💻👩‍💻 We are still on Day 4 of the 30 days of Python code challenge. Now, let's dive into String Manipulation in Python.
String Manipulation in Python 📝

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. You can use various methods to manipulate these characters. Let's take a look at some of them:

    Concatenation: We can concatenate (combine) strings using the + operator.

Example:

# String Concatenation first_name = "Python" last_name = "ista" name = first_name + last_name print(name)

    Repetition: We can repeat a string a certain number of times using the * operator.

Example:

# String Repetition echo = "Echo " * 3 print(echo)

    Indexing: We can access a specific character of a string by referring to its position (index). Python uses zero-based indexing.

Example:

# String Indexing word = "Hello" print(word[0]) # prints 'H'

    Slicing: We can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

Example:

# String Slicing word = "Hello" print(word[1:3]) # prints 'el'

    Length: The len() function returns the length of a string.

Example:

# Length of a string word = "Hello" print(len(word)) # prints 5

    String Methods: Python has several built-in string methods for further manipulation. Some of them are: upper(), lower(), strip(), replace(), split()

Example:

# String Methods word = " Hello, World! " print(word.upper()) print(word.lower()) print(word.strip()) print(word.replace('World', 'Python')) print(word.split(','))
Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁

    Assign your full name to a variable. Print your first name and last name separately using string slicing.

    Print your name in all upper case letters and then in all lower case letters.

    Print the length of your full name.

    Replace your first name with your nickname.

    Split your full name into first name and last name.

Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻💻🌟
